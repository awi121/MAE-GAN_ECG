# advmask_ecg
Adversarial masking for self-supervised pretraining of 12-lead ECGs. 


We adapt parts of our code from the following sources: 
1. Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Networks with CLOCS (https://github.com/danikiyasseh/CLOCS)
2. Adversarial Masking for Self-Supervised Learning (https://github.com/YugeTen/adios)
3. Lead-agnostic Self-supervised Learning for Local and Global Representations of Electrocardiogram (https://github.com/Jwoo5/fairseq-signals)
4. In-depth Benchmarking of Deep Neural Network Architectures for ECG Diagnosis (https://github.com/seitalab/dnn_ecg_comparison)
5. torch_ecg (https://github.com/DeepPSP/torch_ecg/)
